## Story Board (Front End)

(to see the back-end/API repository, go [here](https://github.com/n3m3sis42/story-board-api/ "Story Board API repo"))

This app allows you to storyboard your writing project or novel by creating note cards for each scene in the work. Add, edit and delete scenes whenever you like, and drag and drop scenes to reorder them as you go. Story Board is still in development, but I hope to bring it live soon. At present, I'm working on an outline mode that will allow scenes to be viewed in greater detail.
